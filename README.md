#BINARY TREES

In computer science, a binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child. 

From a graph theory perspective, binary (and K-ary) trees as defined here are actually arborescences. A binary tree may thus be also called a bifurcating arborescence a term which appears in some very old programming books, before the modern computer science terminology prevailed.
